// CcidExchange.kt
// PGPony Android — USB Phase 1
//
// The CCID conversation, one layer above framing and one below USB.
//
// WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE FILE FROM THE TRANSPORT. Everything hard about CCID
// is in the exchange, not in the bytes: the reader can ask for more time an
// unbounded number of times, it echoes a sequence number that is the only way
// to tell a stale reply from the current one, and a bulk read returns whatever
// the endpoint happened to have buffered rather than exactly one message. All
// three are testable with a fake pipe and none of them are testable through
// android.hardware.usb.
//
// This is the same split Ccid.kt and CcidDescriptor.kt already made, and the
// same one MimeEnvelope and QrChunking arrived at the hard way earlier in this
// release: put the logic where a test can reach it, and leave the platform
// class as thin plumbing.
//
// SCOPE. No CCID-level chaining. An APDU larger than the reader's
// dwMaxCCIDMessageLength is reported with the actual limit rather than
// truncated or hung on. See transceiveApdu.
