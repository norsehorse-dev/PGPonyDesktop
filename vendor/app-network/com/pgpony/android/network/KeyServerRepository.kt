// KeyServerRepository.kt
// PGPony Android — Phase A8 + Fix2
//
// Matches iOS KeyServerService.swift.
// Queries keys.openpgp.org VKS API for key discovery and upload.
//
// Phase A8 — unified email lookup:
//   • searchByEmail(email) — backward-compatible signature, returns
//     just the armored key string. Internally now tries WKD advanced →
//     WKD direct → Hagrid before giving up. Existing callers (Exchange,
//     Contacts) get WKD discovery for free without code changes.
//   • findByEmail(email) — new signature returning KeyLookupResult
//     with both the armored key and the source it came from. Use this
//     in new code where the UI wants to label key provenance ("found
//     via WKD" vs "found via keys.openpgp.org") — the import preview
//     in A10 will switch to this.
//
// Phase A8 Fix2 — Hagrid upload now triggers email verification:
//   • upload() previously POSTed the key, discarded the response
//     token, and reported "ok" — leaving the key on Hagrid as
//     "unpublished" (searchable only by fingerprint). Now parses
//     the upload response, extracts the token + per-email status,
//     and automatically POSTs /vks/v1/request-verify so Hagrid
//     emails the user to confirm ownership. The user clicks the
//     link → key becomes searchable by email.
//   • requestVerificationBatch() added for the multi-email case.
//   • Diagnostic Log.d added at WKD/Hagrid decision points so
//     `adb logcat | grep "KeyServer\|WKD"` reveals which source
//     produced (or failed to produce) a key.

     *      pulled out of the key with state "unpublished").

     *      /vks/v1/request-verify with the token + email list. Hagrid
     *      sends a confirmation email to each address. The user clicks
     *      the link in each → that address becomes "published" and
     *      the key becomes searchable by that email.
     *   4. Return KeyServerUploadResult with all the metadata so the
     *      UI can tell the user exactly which addresses got
     *      verification emails.
     *
     * On request-verify failure (rate limit, network blip), the upload
